# Rails React MPA

## About

This is an experimental application using TypeScript, React and Stimulus.

In replacing Action View with React, we are checking whether it can be configured as a Multiple Page App.

## Setup

```
$ bundle
$ npm install
$ bin/rails db:create db:migrate
$ bin/rails s
```

## Thanks

The application structure is based on https://github.com/kjirou/rails-vue-mpa
